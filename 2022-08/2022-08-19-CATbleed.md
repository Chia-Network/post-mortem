## Resolution and recovery

The critical CAT1 vulnerability was discovered by Chia engineers, after potential exposure to this class of concatenation vulnerabilities was reported by Trail of Bits (as part of their general audit of the CAT1 standard). The class of vulnerability reported is a typical class of bug often seen in software when concatenating strings of this variety. The report was immediately investigated by Matt Hauff of the Chia Network team. Matt identified the larger implications of this bug and escalated the report to Richard Kiss. Richard upon investigation, discovered larger security implications and eventually came to the conclusion with Matt that this bug was fatal to the CAT1 standard as it allowed inflation of CAT1 assets without control over the original tail. Once the full impact of the issue was resolved, the Chia team got to work on a plan to handle the disaster response and patch the vulnerability.

Once the severity of the bug was established, the company moved very quickly to establish a monitoring system on chain to identify if the bug has ever been used in the wild and monitor for future use going forward. This alarm was never able to find any evidence of the exploit being used until the Chia team began running the exploit after CAT1 end-of-life in order to resolve outstanding offers.

On June 17th, 3 days post report, we had a working solution to every issue this vulnerability presented. By June 20th we had all the engineering work ready to crash patch the vulnerability should the aforementioned alarm return a positive before end-of-life.

With the monitoring and response plans in place and the software and operations plans ready to go, Chia Network turned our attention to the NFT1 standard going live with the 1.4.0 release. After some internal debate, we decided to favor stability in the NFT standard over absolute secrecy, and we worked the patch to the CAT1 vulnerability into the release for NFT1.

This decision, while a small risk, was mitigated by our monitoring and crash patch response plans as well as the difficulty of identifying this software bug without all the necessary context.
The final plans for CAT1 were put into action after several weeks of intensive internal testing of the 1.5.0 release, which included the CAT2 standard and some other fixes. On July 25th at 10AM Pacific time, we announced the ensuing end-of-life of the CAT1 standard, roughly 24 hours in the future. At roughly 9 am on July 26th, CAT1 standard came to an end at block height 2,311,760. This spurred the next phase of the retirement plan into action.

Chia engineers had been collecting coins for about a week by accepting then valid CAT1 offers to ensure that the pieces needed to accept and cancel all outstanding CAT1 offers were ready. At the end-of-life time, those engineers began using the exploit on chain to mint the amounts of the CAT1s needed to accept and then return xch funds to the affected users.
It is important to note that the acceptance and return of the xch offers were accomplished in the same block, Chia Network was never in possession of any users xch, simply in control of the transaction accepting the offer and routing the offered coin back to the same user.

In this way we avoided massive fraud where malicious third parties could have done this same action and kept the impacted users' xch coins. We viewed this as a necessary step, if a bit extreme. We felt that an ecosystem of users with their funds returned would be far happier than one where some portion lost funds because of long-forgotten offers or similar issues.

With the completion of that work and the publishing of this document, Chia Network views the CAT1 standard officially closed and all extant CAT1 coins to now be of no value. It is advised that all users cease transactions involving CAT1 coins. Conveniently, the exploit allows owners of CAT1 coins to melt them, returning to the owner the constituent mojos that make up each CAT1.

## CVE - Description of the Vulnerability

The CAT1 standard calculates the coin ID of the CAT1 coin being spent by taking the SHA 256 hash of the concatenated parent coin ID, CAT1 coin puzzle hash, and CAT1 coin amount, as shown in this example:
```
(stager
  (list MOD_HASH (sha256 ONE MOD_HASH) TAIL_PROGRAM_HASH)
  (a INNER_PUZZLE inner_puzzle_solution)
  lineage_proof
  (sha256tree1 INNER_PUZZLE)
  ;; calculate coin ID
  (sha256 (f this_coin_info) (f (r this_coin_info)) (f (r (r this_coin_info))))
  prev_coin_id    ; ID
  this_coin_info  ; (parent_id puzzle_hash amount)
  next_coin_proof ; (parent_id innerpuzhash amount)
  prev_subtotal
  extra_delta
)
```
However, this method only ensures that the full set of concatenated bytes is correct and not that the constituting components are correct. If bytes are moved from the end of the CAT1 coin puzzle hash to the beginning of the amount, the same SHA 256 hash will be computed. This enables an incorrect amount to be used, resulting in a larger-sized coin being created. To prevent this, coin IDs must be checked to ensure that constituent components are correct.
```
(defun calculate_coin_id (parent puzzlehash amount)
  (if (all (size_b32 parent) (size_b32 puzzlehash) (> amount -1))
    (sha256 parent puzzlehash amount)
    (x)
  )
)

(stager
  (list MOD_HASH (sha256 ONE MOD_HASH) TAIL_PROGRAM_HASH)
  (a INNER_PUZZLE inner_puzzle_solution)
  lineage_proof
  (sha256tree INNER_PUZZLE)
  ;; calculate coin ID securely
  (calculate_coin_id (f this_coin_info) (f (r this_coin_info)) (f (r (r this_coin_info))))
  prev_coin_id    ; ID
  this_coin_info  ; (parent_id puzzle_hash amount)
  next_coin_proof ; (parent_id innerpuzhash amount)
  prev_subtotal
  extra_delta
)
```

The CAT1 vulnerability is a part of a class of vulnerabilities that can arise from insecure concatenation. Concatenation is commonly combined with hashing, where bytes are concatenated to form a preimage and passed to a hash function. To avoid this class of vulnerability, each component must be checked for correctness before concatenation. An example of this is provided in the `calculate_coin_id function`, where the parent coin ID and puzzle hash are checked for the correct size of 32 bytes, and the amount is checked to be non-negative.

## CWE - How to Recreate the Vulnerability

A coin is represented by a variable length structure of the form `(parent_coin_id puzzle_hash amount)` where the first two fields are 32 bytes, and the last is a `clvm varint` type.
varint examples:
0 = "" (the empty string)
1 = 0x01
50 = 0x32
20000 = 0x4e20
65000 = 0x00fde8 because a varint supports negative values, we prefix numbers that would otherwise have the high bit set with a 00 byte
The solution to a CAT1 puzzle takes a triple of three values for the coin the puzzle is included in. It adds a condition `(ASSERT_MY_ID v)` where v is the calculated coin id using these values via `(sha256 parent_coin_id puzzle_hash amount)`. It further uses the amount value to ensure mojos are neither created nor burned (except when authorized by the tail).
The problem is that sha256 concatenates the passed values when evaluating, and at no time do we ensure that parent_coin_id or puzzle_hash is 32 bytes as expected (or verified to be correct by any other means). That means the boundary between puzzle_hash and amount can be varied, changing the perceived amount of the coin.
So slide over the last byte or two of the puzzle_hash to be the new first byte or two of amount, and you’ve just created a coin worth much more (or, if the first byte has the high bit set, a negative amount!).
This also gives us an easy way to melt CAT coins: move the boundary all the way to the right, so the puzzle_hash field contains all the bytes from the actual puzzle_hash field and the amount field, so the amount field appears to be the empty string, which represents 0.

The CVE for this vulnerability is published on the MITRE CVE website and can be found here: CVE-2022-36447
Security is a critical component of our work, and we maintain a proactive approach by regularly commissioning external audits of Chia code. The discovery of this vulnerability in concert with Trail of Bits is from our third independent audit of Chia code and the second audit of the CAT code, and a report will be published on their findings.

## FAQ
---

#### General Questions

**What is a CAT?**

A CAT is a Chia Asset Token. CATs are fungible tokens that are issued on the chia blockchain. The CAT1 standard was finalized in January 2022. The standard can be found at[  chialisp.com/docs/puzzles/cats/](https://chialisp.com/docs/puzzles/cats/). Some examples of CATs include Stably USD (USDS), Spacebucks (SBX), and Marmot (MRMT).

**Why is this change happening with Chia asset tokens?**

The CAT standard was upgraded to CAT2 based on a security vulnerability found by an outside security audit. This resulted in an upgrade to the latest Chia wallet app as well as updates that will require all original issuers of CAT1 tokens to reissue their tokens on the CAT2 standard and end-of-life support for CAT1s. Chia is working with community members to make this process as seamless as possible.

**Does this change impact Chia Network's security?**

No. There is no threat to the security of Chia Network technology or the Chia Blockchain. The update patched the vulnerability to CAT1.Â

**When does the end-of-life of CAT1 happen?**

CAT1 is end-of-life after block height 2,311,760 which is approximately around 17:00 UTC. This is when the snapshot is taken.

**How can I check my CAT1 balance at the time of the snapshot?**

Go to [cat1.chia.net](https://cat1.chia.net) and provide your pubkey to see the CAT balances that will be airdropped to you when they get re-issued.

**Does everyone have to upgrade?**

We recommend that all CAT (including USDS) holders upgrade to 1.5 as soon as is convenient. The CAT1s that are visible on 1.4 and earlier versions will no longer be supported after the end-of-life block (2,311,760). If you do not own any CATs (for example, if you are a farmer who does not exchange XCH for USDS or any other CAT), then you don't need to upgrade.

**Do I need to upgrade my harvesters?**

This update only affects the wallet software, so you don't need to update your harvesters.

**Are my NFTs or XCH at risk?**

No. NFTs and XCH are not affected by the vulnerability, so no changes are required for them.

**Is there any risk that I'll lose money or my balance will be incorrect during the transition? If so, what do I do?**

If you have any CATs in your wallet, you will want to upgrade to 1.5 as soon as conveniently possible and be sure not to transact with any CATs after the end-of-life block height (2,311,760) has been reached and until you have upgraded to 1.5. This will help ensure that the balance you are expecting is what will be airdropped to you when the CATs are reissued. The[  CAT1 website](https://cat1.chia.net) accurately reflects the CAT1 balance of your wallet as of the end-of-life announcement. It will not dynamically update, but we expect the reissuance process to take approximately a week to fully complete, so the CAT2 balance in your wallet may differ from the CAT1 website balance until the process is done.

**Between the announcement and the end-of-life block height, what should I be doing as a user?**

It is recommended that you:

1.  Cancel any open CAT offers on-chain in your wallet

2.  Do not accept any CAT offers in your 1.4 or lower wallet

3.  Make note of your current CAT1 balances

4.  Upgrade to the latest Chia wallet app (1.5.0 or higher) when it becomes available

**How can I be sure that I've canceled all my open offers?**

Most importantly, you will want to make sure there are no outstanding offers to trade your XCH for someone else's CATs. In addition to canceling the offers in your wallet, you can also send your total balance of XCH to yourself. Due to the chia coinset model, this will ensure that all XCH coins will no longer be available should a rogue or forgotten offer be accepted.

**I may have lost money by transacting, what should I do now?**

Unfortunately, any CAT1 transactions that happen after the end-of-life block height won't be recoverable. For further confirmation, please contact our support team so they can help with checking when the transactions occurred and can help determine if the money is lost or not.

**Do I need to cancel my XCH-for-NFT offers?**

No. Only CAT1 tokens are affected. No changes are being made to NFTs. However, if you have an open CAT-for-NFT offer, then you should cancel it.

**How can I trust that all of my currency will be transferred appropriately?**Â

You can check your CAT1 balance as of the snapshot through our [website](https://cat1.chia.net) using your pub key.

We are providing tools and support to the community developers to help ensure that they can reissue the new CATs in a timely manner. All CAT reissuers will be going by token balances at the same end-of-life block height.

**What happens to my CAT1s?**

Your existing CAT1 tokens still exist on the blockchain, but they are of no more use as everyone upgrades to CAT2s. You will be airdropped CAT2 to replace your CAT1 based on your balance as of block height of 2,311,760. Once you upgrade to 1.5, you will no longer see any balances for your original CATs.

**How long will it take for me to get all my tokens airdropped to me?**

This will depend on when the original issuers re-issue their tokens based on the new CAT2 standard. We hope that it is soon after the CAT1 EOL date. It is recommended to follow any social media, or discord for the CAT token projects so you can hear first hand when to expect the airdrop.

**What happens if I have a transaction with a CAT1 token after the block height snapshot?**

You will only be airdropped the balance of the tokens at the time the snapshot is taken. Any transactions that occur after the snapshot will not be accounted for in the airdrop provided to you.

**How can I trust that all of my currency will be transferred appropriately? Is there any risk that I'll lose money or my balance will be incorrect during the transition? If so, what do I do?**

Your CAT1 tokens won't be transferred. Instead, you will be given an identical (in value) set of CAT2 tokens. The blockchain already contains a complete record of all coins in the coinset. We have developed a tool that will use the blockchain to calculate a complete snapshot of CAT1 tokens. This snapshot will be accurate as of CAT1's end-of-life block.

However, the CAT1 issuers do need to perform a complete airdrop of CAT2 tokens. If the airdrop is not completed, or even started, then there is a risk that you will not receive your upgraded CAT2 tokens. In this case, you should ask the issuer to make the upgrade.

**I am the issuer of a CAT1 token. What should I do?**

[Follow this document](https://docs.chia.net/docs/cat2/cat2-intro), which will guide you through the process of reissuing your token as a CAT2.

#### Chia App Questions

**I upgraded to 1.5, but I don't see any of my tokens yet. Did I do something wrong?**

No, you didn't do anything wrong. The Chia Wallet app, as of 1.5, only shows you your XCH, and CAT2 balances. As not all CATs will be re-issued immediately, when your CAT2s show up in your wallet is dependent on when original issuers issue their updated CAT2s.

**The balance of my airdrop in my wallet doesn't match the balance that the website shows me, what should I do?**

First, please consult the CAT1 balance[  website](https://cat1.chia.net) to view your historical CAT1 balances. We expect the full reissuance process to take approximately a week to complete.

If your CAT2 balances in the 1.5.0 wallet do not match the CAT1 historical reference, then check what your wallet derivation index is at and compare it to the derivation index. The derivation index is shown in the balance on the Tokens screen.

![Chia client](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lLwgjXXYjw22E5SX8TSDsFNB-XMPQ0zhS6OSh8UmP8kbp0NoWMxoAenYYhLKOUciFWdo7badLgTIvHksdUugE2k9W4SExUNdf7gdVA0IYO2XpzOaoSnFBJPpsfXnrkhOVMOs8CWjt08LasfNQuwnxPY)

If the derivation index in your wallet is less than the highest derivation index found on the website, you will want to update the derivation index in the wallet. To do so, go to Settings > Derivation index and type in the number that you get from the [cat1.chia.net](https://www.chia.net/2022/07/25/cat1.chia.net) website.

![Chia client](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/b2qA0DUWQX_J8gJLN0uChP5klN5lw3kase29QUcdx30EK-nnsGTWqTLj20G83DG9puVpSA07HkDcGy_9lNG82g5T2SGV0cY-gSA0eGbPtJ81ARr8xqUFyKY5TYiGzU9I-W90_HpVyb3MoiQlyX28iVA)

**I've tried all the recommendations, but the reissuer didn't get my wallet balance correct. What should I do?**

After trying all the above steps and at least a week has passed since the announcement and your CAT2 airdropped balance still doesn't match, then we recommend reaching out directly to the reissue of the relevant CAT1 token.

**How do I cancel my open offers to exchange CATs?**

From the Chia Wallet user interface:

1.  Go to the Offers tab in the left hand navigation

2.  Find all Offers you created that show a status of "Pending Accept"

3.  Click on the three dots under "Actions"

4.  Click on "Cancel Offer"

5.  Ensure "Cancel on blockchain" option is selected

6.  Enter a fee (optional, but recommended)

7.  Click on "Cancel Offer"

From the Chia Wallet command line:

1.  Run chia wallet cancel_offer along with the parameters needed to cancel any open offers. See [here](https://docs.chia.net/docs/13cli/nft_cli) for documentation on how to use the command line arguments.

**After upgrading to 1.5, I've lost all of my wallet transaction history. How do I access my previous transaction history with CATs or XCH?**

After upgrading to 1.5, a new wallet database is created to preserve any previous copies of wallet DBs. You can install a previous version of the Chia wallet app, and that older client will look for your previous wallet db and display the transaction history for XCH, CATs, and NFTs that occurred in that wallet before upgrading to 1.5

**How do I know when the updated tokens have been airdropped to my wallet?**

You should follow the projects for the tokens that you own so you can be notified when they have begun running the airdrops. You can also monitor your Chia wallet app, and look under the "Manage token list" to see if a new CAT2 has been airdropped to you.

**Why doesn't the balance in my wallet match the balance reported on the website?**

Get the Derivation index from the website and update the derivation index in the Chia wallet app. This will ensure the balance reported on the website matches up with the balance in your wallet.

**What is a "Derivation Index"?**

The derivation index is a numeric value that is used to track how many wallet addresses have been used based on the most recent transaction. This helps establish a window for which wallet addresses to scan for on the blockchain to find all possible coins owned by a specific wallet.

**Why do I see multiple tokens with the same value in my 1.5 wallet?**

It is possible that you have received multiple identical airdrops from different parties. Only one of them will be the real CAT2 token. To determine which one is real, click "MANAGE TOKEN LIST" and click "Search on Tail Database". Only the original CAT1 issuer will be allowed to register their CAT2 equivalent on Tail Database, so you should use it as the source of truth for naming your CAT2 tokens.

**Who can I contact if I have any problems or questions?**

The Chia Network Support Team is available to answer questions and provide assistance through this process in the official[  Keybase support](https://keybase.io/team/chia_network.public) channel.

#### [cat1.chia.net](https://cat1.chia.net/) Website Questions

**How do I find the pubkey to enter into the website?**

From the Chia Wallet user interface:

1.  Go to "Select Key" screen and click on the "See private key"

2.  Copy the "public key" from the list of keys available

![Chia client](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pDyW40byLBEr-5PgFiBJcrrSmE7ER_ui0CsD9_GZpz17zb6I7JymNfPI2uuVrgX5qN7M-P3bG-U0MWF2-jbgiRM2zq3XLidbX4RNz49Xxmz5UaM0XwKmOJ5T8fw5ezeN0hboy6FIMXvxBAvxKqJbxzo)

From the Chia wallet command line:

1.  Run chia keys show

2.  Copy the "master public key" from the list of keys available

**I checked the website (cat1.chia.net) and I don't see any tokens for my wallet, but there should be. What can I do?**

Confirm the pubkey you entered into the website is correct and had a CAT1 token balance, and is for an unhardened key

Click on the "Search next 1000" to see if your balance has been updated.

**The balance that the website is reporting doesn't match what I expect. What should I do?**

The website scans the first 1000 wallet receive addresses, and if the balance doesn't reflect what you expect, then you should hit the "search next 1000" for the website to scan and update the balance found. We expect most users to get their correct balance from the initial search, but some users might need an expanded search.

**My CH21 balance is reported incorrectly on the website. What should I do?**

CH21 tokens were issued to non-observer keys, so they won't show up in the website unless they've been transferred at some point using a wallet without forcing the non-observer key support. The CAT standard was released at the same time as support for observer keys, so generally most CATs and wallets will be supported by the website. Even if your CH21 tokens are not displayed on the website, a CAT2 version will still be airdropped into your 1.5 wallet.

**I am running 1.5 and when I view an offer, instead of the CAT token, I see XCH. What's going on?**

You are likely viewing an offer for a CAT1 which will be an invalid offer starting with version 1.5. The reason for this is because tail ids for CAT1s are no longer recognized by the wallet.

![Chia client](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VI0HRORsrG7w1jR3SgTS51BypcUiqhWMqzknlAtFxH0R19_SsKvEMO9X3BEs5-YNz3QNl8j6CraxleGHPS-p9UZbk7_3bthT4gNJp_696NvTgOOOBWBJLxn7wZkvnyzW6FwmdTXV21WBcsXU6fbxBFM)

### Wallet Developer Questions

**I am developing a Chia wallet. What changes do I need to make to my code?**

CAT2 inner puzzles do not enforce prepended announcements. If you preprend a coin announcement with 0xca (which was a requirement for CAT1), then the announcement will fail with ANNOUNCE_CONSUMED_FAILED. Instead, do not prepend inner puzzle announcements with anything.

Note that announcements coming from the CAT layer still need to be prepended with 0xcb. This has not changed in CAT2.
